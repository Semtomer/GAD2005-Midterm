Midterm Project    
Develop a clone of 1010! by Gram Games.

There should be a grid of 10x10 tiles. There should be 3 randomly generated pieces of various shapes spawned in the hand area. The player should be able to drag the pieces in the hand area onto the grid and place them. Whenever a piece is dropped onto an already occupied tile, it should move back to the hand area. Whenever a piece is dropped onto empty tiles, it should stay there. Whenever a row or a column is filled up, all tiles in the row / column should explode and free up the space. This should grant the player some victory points. The game ends if the pieces in the hand area can not be placed onto the grid and then the total score should be displayed.
